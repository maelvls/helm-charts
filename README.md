# Helm-charts

A Helm chart for running users-server in Kubernetes. The user-server
binary is part of the [users-grpc](https://github.com/maelvls/users-grpc),
a project I wrote to show some interesting development techniques such as
TDD and CLI testing.

The source code for this helm repository is
[here](https://github.com/maelvls/helm-charts).
