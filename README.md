# Helm-charts

A Helm chart for running users-server in Kubernetes. The user-server
binary is part of the [users-grpc](https://github.com/maelvls/users-grpc),
a project I wrote to show some interesting development techniques such as
TDD and CLI testing.

To see what options you can use in your `values.yaml`, take a look at the
[Helm chart source](https://github.com/maelvls/users-grpc/tree/master/ci/helm/users-grpc
(more specifically, look at the `values.yaml` file there).

> The source code for this helm repository is [here](https://github.com/maelvls/helm-charts).
